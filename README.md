# RECYCLEd CardStock V2.0

![UML Diagram](CardStock.png)

## Project Goals

CardStock is a General Game Playing engine for card games implemented 
in C#. Games are written in RECYCLE, a card game description language, and
then simulations are run with random, simple, and complex AI players. CardStock can then
analyze the games to determine heuristics about the games
such as fairness, decisiveness, drama, or clarity, and generate transcripts of
each simulation for further study.

We are currently in the process of abstracting and refactoring CardStock to allow
for new game functionality and setting up a modular system for a
tournament of AI players. Please check back for further progress on these issues.

## Games
